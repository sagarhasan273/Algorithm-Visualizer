<p style="font-size: 16px;">I Never Copy Code In my life. I learn from them. It is very sad when people ask where did you get this code from. Well, I made this project by my self using React.js</p>

## I have used my inner thought to visualize those algorithms and Data Structures by traversing verious websites and have learnt new techniques (On Going...).

# Binary Search-Visualizer
I've created a novel binary search visualization with the aim of making it more accessible and understandable for students. My intention is to assist teachers in effectively conveying this concept to their students.

### Binary Search Unique

# Dynamic Programming-Visualizer
DP visualizer is a visualization tool for some DP standard problems, which helps to understand DP technique in general and how to use it to solve these problems in particular.

### So far the visualizer includes 2 problems 4 ways:
  - 01knapsack Recursive.
  - 01knapsack Tabulation.
  - Fibonacci Recursive.
  - Fibonacci Tabulation.

### 0-1Knapsack Recursive:

# Recursion-Visualizer
Recursion visualizer is a visualization tool for understanding Recursive technique to solve problems.

### So far the visualizer includes 2 problems 2 ways:
  - Recursion.
  - Recursion Tree.
### Recursion Tree
